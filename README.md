FROM Flights f
JOIN Airlines a ON f.airline_id = a.airline_id
JOIN Airports ap1 ON f.from_airport_id = ap1.airport_id
JOIN Airports ap2 ON f.to_airport_id = ap2.airport_id
WHERE ap1.city = 'Hyderabad' AND ap2.city = 'Bangalore';
```

### 2. All Bookings of a Passenger:
```sql

FROM Bookings b
JOIN Flights f ON b.flight_id = f.flight_id
WHERE b.passenger_id = 101;
```

### 3. Total Revenue per Flight:
```sql
SELECT f.flight_id, SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Flights f
JOIN Bookings b ON f.flight_id = b.flight_id
JOIN Payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
WHERE f.flight_id = 1001
GROUP BY f.flight_id;
